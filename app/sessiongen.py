"""On-the-spot practice session generation, slide-anchored.

Sessions never draw from a pre-banked question pool. When a practice session is
created we:
  1. Select slides from the chosen lectures (or all lectures).
  2. Generate a fresh question per slide via DeepSeek (capped at MAX_QUESTIONS).
  3. Record each question's coordinate (lecture_id, slide_id) and store it.
Answering tags wrong questions into the `missed` table for next-day review.

The slide is the atomic unit: every question is anchored to a specific slide's
text + OCR + caption, so there is no separate "concept" layer to drift or
duplicate content. Redundancy in questions simply mirrors redundancy in the
source slides themselves.

    "mechanism, interpret a finding, link a concept to an outcome). Avoid trivial one-step "
    "recall of isolated bullet points.\n"
    "3. Anchored to the source slide: the correct answer must be directly supported by the "
    "biomedical content on the slide. Do not invent facts absent from the slide. Distractors "
    "must be plausible but clearly wrong given that content.\n"
    "4. IGNORE all non-examinable slide material: course objectives, textbook "
    "recommendations, syllabi, schedules, logistics, instructor names, grading, or 'how to "
    "study'. Never write a question about the course or its materials themselves.\n"

Q. A 24-year-old primigravida is diagnosed with a primary cytomegalovirus infection at 8 weeks' gestation. Which statement best predicts the consequence for the fetus?
A. The virus cannot cross the placenta, so fetal infection will not occur
B. The virus crosses the placenta and can cause fetal infection
C. Crossing is limited to small molecules; viruses are too large to pass
D. Crossing occurs only after 32 weeks' gestation
E. Crossing requires concurrent maternal bacteremia

Q. During implantation, endometrial stromal cells enlarge, accumulate glycogen and lipids, become polyhedral, and eventually undergo apoptosis. Which process do these changes represent, and what is its primary role?
A. Zonal reaction - prevents polyspermy
B. Cortical reaction - blocks additional sperm entry
C. Decidual reaction - supports and protects the implanting embryo
D. Acrosome reaction - enables penetration of the zona pellucida
E. Inflammatory reaction - rejects the embryo

Q. A patient with chronic kidney disease has impaired renal activation of vitamin D. Which downstream effect is most likely to develop as a direct consequence?
A. Increased intestinal calcium absorption

QUESTION_BATCH_PROMPT = """Write NBME/USMLE-style single-best-answer questions for a medical student.

You are given {count} slides. Return EXACTLY {count} questions - on average one per slide.

Each slide is presented as:
SLIDE <index> | Lecture: <lecture title> | Slide number: <slide_num>
<slide text + image caption>

SOURCE MATERIAL is for you only - the student never sees it.

RULES:
1. A slide is NON-TESTABLE if it contains only a thank-you message, "Questions?", a title or lecturer header, learning objectives, a schedule, a references list, a pure summary/review/overview recap with no new facts (e.g. a slide titled "Summary" or "Review"), or other administrative content with no biomedical facts. Do NOT write a question for a non-testable slide.
2. To still return exactly {count} questions, when you skip a non-testable slide write an ADDITIONAL question anchored to another TESTABLE slide in this batch instead. A slide may be the source of more than one question, so slide_index may repeat. Every question must be strictly based on the slide it is anchored to.
3. Backfill anchors MUST be genuinely testable content slides (slides with concrete biomedical facts). Summary, review, thank-you, and "Questions?" slides are non-testable and must NEVER be used as anchors, even as a last resort. If no testable slide is available to anchor an extra question, return fewer than {count} questions rather than writing a weak, meta, or summary-style question.
4. Each question must be board-style and self-contained: a clinical vignette or mechanism prompt requiring 2nd-3rd order reasoning. Never reference "this slide", "the slide above", the lecture, or any unseen material.
5. Do not name specific diseases, drugs, enzymes, or proteins that are not explicitly named in the slide the question is anchored to.

EXAM STYLE REFERENCE:
{examples}

Return ONLY JSON:
{{
  "questions": [
    {{
      "slide_index": 0,
      "question": "Self-contained stem. Do NOT include answer letters or reference unseen material.",

      "explanation": "Teaching explanation, 2-5 sentences: why correct is right, why the strongest distractors are wrong, and the high-yield takeaway."
